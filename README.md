The Student Report Card System enables teachers or administrators to enter student details along with marks obtained in various subjects. The system automatically computes the total marks, average 
percentage,and assigns grades according to the defined criteria. It displays all the information in a clear tabular report format for each student. This project primarily uses Java (Swing/Console) for the 
interface and OOP concepts for logical structuring. The data is temporarily stored in arrays or objects during runtime, but it can easily be extended to use file handling or database integration (JDBC).
The program also handles invalid inputs gracefully and ensures that users can process multiple students at once. This mini-project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like class creation, 
encapsulation, control structures, and loops. It also reflects how Java can be applied to build small-scale yet effective management tools. Future improvements may include GUI-based enhancements and 
persistent data storage.
